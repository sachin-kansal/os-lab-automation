ssh -i ~/.ssh/redhat_lab sachin@192.168.31.56


Day3: Users and password

in linux passwords are stored in 
/etc/passwd
      --> jane:x:1001:1001:Jane Doe:/home/jane:/bin/bash
      jane : user
      x: password
      1001 --> user uid (
            uid == 0 : root
            uid >0 and uid <1000 : system users
            uid > 1000 : simple users
      )
      1001 --> group gid
      Jane Doe --> fullname or description
      /home/jane --> home directory
      /bin/bash --> default shell      
/etc/shadow
  openssl passwd -6 "user1
  creates hash for the password "user1" random each time and cannot be reverted
  $<id>$<salt>$<hashed_password>

/etc/group
 --> group info
/etc/gshadow
 --> group passwords

which consists of information of repos mantained by the distributer.
these repo consists of .rpm file for redhat just like .exe
which are used to install the binaries or code.

dbf install <software/package name>
dnf search <package>
