Create a VM, take a snapshot. Ideas:

create a user

remove a user

create a user with a specific UID/GID and make sure it’s in a particular group.

add ssh keys to said user

create a file

delete the file

use the template module to create a file. Put the amount of memory the system has in a file.

Now edit an existing file by adding some lines. Add another DNS server or repo to your package manager

Now add some lines in the middle of a file. Use regex to determine where to put the added lines.

similarly, remove lines from a file. Even if it’s a comment, just practice taking it out.

install some programs

Now something harder. Use that snapshot to quickly revert your changes when it doesn’t work. Now set up a basic website:

Install the web server

template out the configuration

create a different user to run the web server. Edit the configuration accordingly

template out the index.html file and fill it with some system statistics (# of CPUs, amount of RAM, HDD space, cpu usage, mem usage, etc.)

make sure the permissions on the website files is correct

change the firewall to allow access

Once you can do that, I think you’d know enough to start tackling actual problems you have.

Another challenge: make your playbook that sets up the website idempotent. Run it a second time and it should make no changes. This one can be tricky, sometimes you may need to write tasks that check if things are a certain way, and then use ‘when:’ conditionals on tasks that make the changes. Ansible should define how things should be, and not just be a list of changes to make. It took a while to wrap my head around this.
